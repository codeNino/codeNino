### ðŸ’«About Me :

Iâ€™m Samuel, a Software Engineer and Data Scientist currently living and working in Nigeria. I'm driven by an ambition to build really useful products and so I love working on impactful projects especially when it involves leveraging AI to deliver cutting edge solutions to people and businesses.

As a Backend Engineer, I excel as a technical ideator and love to think about scalable design patterns and systems architecture. In other words, I build according to design. Since January 2023, Iâ€™ve been working again as a freelancer and currently building a telemedicine platform for a prospective Healthtech start-up in Nigeria where I am taking ownership of the product Systems including the development and deployment of the complete backend infrastructure written mostly in Go (Golang).


Prior to this, I was at [Glodaris Technologies](https://www.glodaris.com/) where I spent 1 year building a Microservices based Facial Recognition driven security solution for one of the business' clients with Python, FastAPI and some cloud-native techs.

 
I recently took a dive into open source projects on the side with my first Go package published -
* [ratelimiter](https://www.github.com/codenino/ratelimiter) - an Open source rate limiting Go (Golang) package that provides a HTTP middleware adaptable for Gin web servers.
 
* [Also have some mini projects I have worked on in the past two years](https://github.com/codenino?tab=repositories).

Outside of work, I recharge with football and I also love getting educated on diverse subject matters, putting my nose into all that space stuff, and more importantly investing time with family and friends.
